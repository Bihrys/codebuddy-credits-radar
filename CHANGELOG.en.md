All notable changes are documented in this file.

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- **Automatic CodeBuddy sign-in reuse (accessToken mode)**: when CodeBuddy is installed and signed in,
  the extension reads the `accessToken` (JWT) from its sign-in state and calls the APIs with
  `Authorization: Bearer` — no more Cookies, and no more Cookie expiry / UA-binding pain.
- **Persistent token cache (the keychain is read once)**: the token read on the first run is cached in the
  extension's own SecretStorage (encrypted by VS Code, no authorization needed to use it), so the keychain
  is not touched again until the token nears expiry (~60 days). If a keychain read fails, the extension stops
  retrying for the session instead of repeatedly prompting.
- New `codebuddyUsage.accessToken` setting and command **`CodeBuddy Usage: Paste Access Token (when auto-read fails)`**
  as the only manual fallback; submitting an empty value clears it and retries auto-read.
- The hover tooltip now shows the auth source (e.g. `✓ Auto token · 11-14`) along with the token expiry date.
- Reading state.vscdb now prefers Node's built-in `node:sqlite` and no longer requires the system `sqlite3` command.

### Changed

- **Cookie mode removed**: the `codebuddyUsage.cookie` setting and the "Set login credentials (Cookie + User-Agent)"
  command are gone; authentication is now accessToken-only.
- The "No Cookie set" notice became "No credentials found", and "Cookie expired" became "Login expired";
  the hover tooltip now also includes the concrete reason (e.g. keychain access denied).

### Notes

- Decrypting the local sign-in state requires the system keychain (macOS) — that is macOS's security model and
  cannot be bypassed. Persistent caching + "stop on failure" reduce the access rate to roughly once per 60 days;
  click "Always Allow" on the first prompt.
- Auto-read is macOS-only for now; on Windows / Linux paste an `accessToken` manually.
- The extension **never calls refreshToken**: CodeBuddy refreshes and writes back the token itself, so the extension
  simply re-reads it — avoiding two sides rotating each other's session.

## [0.8.3]

### Added

- When the claim response omits the credit amount, the extension now falls back to the travel
  records endpoint and reads `reward_credit` for that trip, so the notification shows the real
  amount (e.g. "Claimed 8 credits"). The `reward_credit` field of the `status` endpoint is
  always `0` in practice and cannot be used.

### Fixed

- Fixed a successful claim producing no notification at all: a missing or `0` `credit` in the
  `claim` response was treated as "nothing to claim" and silently ignored. A server-confirmed
  claim now always notifies; if the amount is unknown it notifies without an amount.
- Fixed the "once per day" claim guard skipping the second trip of a day (e.g. an overnight trip
  plus a new trip the same day, which means two claims in one day): claiming is now triggered
  when either the trip identifier changes or the trip just ended.
- Failed claims are still retried on the next refresh, but the failure warning pops up at most
  once a day instead of on every 30-minute refresh.

## [0.8.2]

### Fixed

- Fixed the travel time still being reported as 0 hours: the 0.8.1 fallback only kicked in when
  the `depart` response's duration field was `null` / `undefined`, while the server actually returns
  a placeholder `0` (and `??` does not skip `0`), so the `status` lookup was never reached.
  Now, after a successful `depart`, the duration always comes from the `status` endpoint's
  `duration_hours` (matching what the website shows); the positive value from the `depart` response
  is only used when `status` yields nothing.

## [0.8.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed the buddy-depart notification wrongly reporting "travel time 0 hours": the successful
  `depart` response does not always carry a `duration_hours` / `duration` field, and the old code
  fell back to `0`, disagreeing with the real travel time shown on the website (e.g. 2 hours).
  When the duration cannot be read from the `depart` response, the extension now re-queries the
  `status` endpoint and uses the server-registered `duration_hours`, or falls back to deriving it
  from the difference between `arrive_at` and `depart_at`, matching what the website displays.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- **Bilingual UI (English / Simplified Chinese)**: the extension now follows the VS Code display language.
  Manifest strings use `package.nls.json` / `package.nls.zh-cn.json`; runtime strings use `vscode.l10n.t()`
  with `l10n/bundle.l10n.zh-cn.json`. English is the built-in default and requires no extra file.
- English documentation: `README.en.md` and this file.

### Changed

- Shortened the English tooltip strings (status tags, table headers, summary line, …) so the tooltip stays as compact as the Chinese one and no longer wraps inside columns.

### Fixed

- The "total" link in the hover tooltip was hard-coded to the `.cn` site; it now follows the `apiBase` setting.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Buddy travel notifications: when the automatic flow actually **claims credits** or **successfully dispatches the buddy**,
  an information notification pops up, consistent with the check-in one (merged into a single summary per refresh).
- Manually clicking "Claim" / "Depart" in the tooltip now always gives feedback:
  success / nothing to claim / failure are all reported (previously the `0 credits` and failure branches were completely silent).

### Fixed

- Buddy claim and depart failures were only written into the tooltip tag with no notification at all, so they were easy to miss.

### Docs

- Fixed a self-contradictory statement in the README's "automatic check-in" section: only an already-completed check-in is silent; the first successful claim does notify.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **Configurable User-Agent**: new `codebuddyUsage.userAgent` setting.
  The server binds the full UA when issuing a session and returns 401 on any mismatch,
  and neighbouring Chrome versions are not interchangeable. Leave it empty to use the built-in default `Chrome/153`.
- Setting credentials now shows two input boxes in a row (Cookie → User-Agent) with `(1/2)` `(2/2)` in the titles;
  pressing `Esc` at any step cancels the whole flow, so a half-mismatched pair is never written.
- The actually effective UA version is echoed back after saving, so you can confirm it was written.

### Changed

- The command `Set login Cookie` was renamed to `Set login credentials (Cookie + User-Agent)`.
- README gained an "About User-Agent" section describing the observed session-binding behaviour.

### Fixed

- Fixed "the pasted User-Agent reverts to the default": the previous Webview form used
  `retainContextWhenHidden: false`, so hiding the panel (switching to the browser to copy)
  destroyed the JS context and rebuilding it reset the input. Replaced with native input boxes,
  which have no such lifecycle issue.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Buddy travel: claims credits and dispatches the buddy automatically; the tooltip shows the countdown and manual action links.
- The tooltip footer shows today's check-in status tag.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Automatic daily check-in to claim credits.
